# Invitation

We invite you to help us to build a better way of life for all humans - the way that is grounded upon the principles and the values and the beliefs that we think will help individual person to lead a happy life and also to help the whole society become a good place for humans to live and realize their collective potential to sustain it.

## What do we do?

Invitation by appeals
 - convincing via discussions and deeds
 - Basic rules:
   - Rome wasn't built in a day! We must be patient!
   - Nature doesn't seem to give any one thing without letting go of some other thing! We must be ready and be happy to sacrifice some things we like, some things we love in order to make to an effort to gain some things we believe are desirable for our goal!

## Who we are?

We are a bunch of humans, first and foremost, who believe in the cause stated on this website. We are committed to the cause to the best of our abilities but we beleive that this needs a collective effort. There is NO single person who is giving us the orders or guidelines or guidance and this all is a collective effort.

Having said this, we know that to connect with other people one needs to be wishing to connect first. Here in brief we give some information as to who we are and how you may connect with us. This information shall be updated as needed so please keep visiting us.

This project is completely a volunteer effort.

Currently the site is maintained mainly by Mr. Swanand Dhawan, who is a software developer working in the industry. More about him on this[^swanand] page.

The basic idea of this project was started by one Mr. K Damodar inspired by the great efforts and deeds by various people from the past and current. Mr. Damodar is currently working as a member of faculty in an academic institution. More about on this[^damodar] page.

## Our basic code of conduct

General code of conduct we expect from ourselves:
 - no need to feel an urge/itch to win debates - even when others are trying to win - yet every attempt must be made to convince the other person about how and why our point of views are morally better and thus our opinions are morally and then [maybe] scientifically also better. Winning friends is much, much more important than winning debates/medals.
 - absolute no to resorting to any cheap tricks and tactics during discussions to distract the other person from what they seem to be telling in order to score points. Tricks like interrupting one's flow, throwing some difficult words at them, quick to point out simple or even seemingly big errors in their language usage or even in their views etc.
 - no strawmanning - instead we must try to steelman others' stances. No need to focus on the weak points [mistakes] in their arguments too much.
 - no showoff of knowledge or almost any thing - especially language fluency and/or vocabulary prowess, especially in our discussions
 - no showoff of superiority of even a lot of cases concerning morality, unless it comes to absolutely non-negotiable stances regarding the most fundamental moral choice - 'we wish to reduce overall human suffering with unwavering faith in the superiority of collective efforts and an unwavering commitment to scientific temperament when it comes to ideas'
 - that is, we believe in the superiority of attempts to reduce human suffering that are grounded in the best possible, available knowledge [science] rather than letting it be based upon reliance upon appeal to some imagined supernatural power(s) and that we believe that fundamentally science itself is a fruit of collective human effort.
