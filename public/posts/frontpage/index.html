<p>Main objective: Bring sustainable changes to society by convincing people through dialogue and appeals that we must try collectively to reduce the overall human suffering and help individuals live a happy life.</p>
<p>We believe that we must realize that no human must be considered below dignity! We believe that we must realize that our main and ultimate fight must be against the undesirable traits within us! We believe that dividing humans in &ldquo;us&rdquo; vs &ldquo;them&rdquo; shall be detrimental to most of our fundamental humanist goals! [^Humanist Manifesto]</p>
<hr>
<p>We need all the help you as a human being can provide to humanity. Here are the main areas we can and must contribute to improve the overall situation for humanity:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the most destructive forces the humanity faces that can destroy us from within is addiction to certain substances; we believe that we must do everything we can to help people overcome their dependance on any kind of addictions.</li>
<li>Another of the most destructive forces the humanity faces that can destroy us from within our desire or urge to seek thrills and entertainments of various sorts even when most of our needs are fulfilled and even when we are already enjoying a life that can considered as comfortable; we believe that we must do everything we can to help people overcome their over-dependance on any kind of thrill-seeking and entertainment-seeking activities.</li>
<li>Yet another of the most destructive forces the humanity faces that can destroy us from within our desire or urge to seek thrills and entertainments of various sorts even when most of our needs are fulfilled and even when we are already enjoying a life that can considered as comfortable; we believe that we must do everything we can to help people overcome their over-dependance on any kind of thrill-seeking and entertainment-seeking activities.</li>
<li>Yet another of the most destructive forces the humanity faces that can destroy us from within our desire or urge to pursue only personally enjoyable goals; we believe that we must do everything we can to help people overcome their over-indulgence in any kind of activities that are very much centered around only self.</li>
</ul>
<p>We request you humbly to go through this site, read our thoughts, our appeals and do give a charitable consideration to our pleas.</p>
<p>In brief, some important areas we wish to focus on are as under:</p>
<ul>
<li>helping children to learn to learn</li>
<li>helping people to help children to learn to learn</li>
<li>helping people suffering from various sorts of destructive habits/addictions and undesirable goals</li>
<li>helping people who are looking to help themselves</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Our core beliefs:</p>
<ul>
<li>we consider the humanistic values to be sacred, sacrosanct</li>
<li>we consider that scientific temperament is the best belief system the humanity has come up to deal with many problems arising in Nature</li>
<li>we do not consider scientific temperament to be sacred though, that is, we consider that scientific temperament is the best system as of now to approach science and to build technology and that there is a possibility that humans may improve it further; more importantly we are aware of the limits of scientific temperament and rationality especially when it comes to do anything meaningful for some shared goal [Please read the article titled &ldquo;Limits of rationality&rdquo; in this context.]</li>
<li>we consider that humans with belief in the objective stated above can work together to achieve a better society for us without needing a belief/disbelief in any supernatural being(s) or supernatural power(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>We do invite you to this way of life. Of course, we believe that people must be free to believe in any any supernatural powers [commonly referred to by the word God] to seek solace in case of events that are distressing and are mostly unexplainable and obviously uncontrollable, at least as of now. e.g. death; or cancer like situations.</p>
<hr>
<p>Our general policy: No criticism of any religious figure, personalities, identities per se - as it&rsquo;s perceived by most people as ad-hominem attacks and thus results in unnecessary distraction and repels people; instead we put our points in front of the people and let people come to conclusions at paces they find comfortable.</p>
<p>Indeed, we strongly believe that there are many good beliefs and doctrines in various mainstream religions which we must pay careful attention to and must draw upon from.</p>
<p>Our general guiding principle: instead of focusing on the negative practices in various religions we must present the better alternatives by pointing out the evil practices themselves without targeting any faith and invite people to the alternatives.</p>
<p>So we believe in the promotion of our core beliefs in:</p>
<ul>
<li>humanistic values</li>
<li>scientific temperament as a very valuable tool, created/discovered collectively by humans, to serve humanistic values and to achieve goals set accordingly by humans</li>
</ul>
